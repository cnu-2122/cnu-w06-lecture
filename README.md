# Computing and Numerics - Week 6 lecture

- The file `week_06_lecture.ipynb` contains the notebook used for the slides in the live online lecture.
- The file `int_plots.py` contains the code used to create the plots and estimate the integral. It's adapted from the code you already have in your tutorial sheet.
